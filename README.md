About this project:
-
This car is handled by radio waves using the remote control. The remote has a screen that displays some options. We can turn on / off the headlights and stops, we can select the high beam and the low beam, we can turn the hazard lights on or off.
The ESC interprets the signal received from the remote control and decides the engine status. If the joystick is up, the car accelerates.
If, after accelerating, the joystick is down, the brake is triggered.
If it did not accelerate or the brake was triggered and the joystick is down, the car goes backwards.
The engine is powerful, the battery is large and the radio can communicate at a distance of up to 1km
